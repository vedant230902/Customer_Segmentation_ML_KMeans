# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

Customer segmentation using KMeans is a common application of the KMeans clustering algorithm in marketing and business analytics. It involves grouping customers into distinct segments based on similarities in their purchasing behavior and annual income. Here's how the process typically works:

1.**Data Collection**: Gather relevant data about customers, which include transaction history and annual income that will be used for segmentation.

2.**Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, scale features if necessary, and prepare it for clustering. Feature selection or dimensionality reduction techniques may also be applied to reduce the number of variables and improve clustering performance.

3.**Plotting the Elbow plot**: 
The elbow plot is a visualization used to identify the optimal number of clusters (k) in a KMeans clustering algorithm. It helps in determining the point at which adding more clusters ceases to explain a significant amount of variance in the data. It is plotted with the no. of clusters on the X-axis and the SSE(Sum of Squared Errors) on the Y-axis.

4.**Applying KMeans Clustering**: Use the KMeans algorithm to partition the customer data into the specified number of clusters. The algorithm assigns each customer to the nearest cluster centroid based on their feature values.
